# Indian-Medicinal-Plant-Identification
This project utilizes machine learning techniques to identify and classify medicinal plants from images.
The goal is to aid botanists, herbalists, and researchers in accurately identifying medicinal plants for various purposes, such as herbal medicine production and conservation efforts.
#Features
Plant Species Classification: The model can classify images of plant leaves into different medicinal plant species.
High Accuracy: The model achieves high accuracy in plant species identification, enabling reliable detection of medicinal plants.
User-Friendly Interface: The project includes a user-friendly interface for uploading plant leaf images and obtaining species classification results.
Fast Processing: The prediction process is fast, allowing for quick analysis of large datasets of plant images.
#Usage
To use the medicinal plant detection model, follow these steps:

#Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies specified in the model.
Launch the application by running python notebook in jupyter notebbok.
Upload an image of a plant leaf to the application.
View the predicted medicinal plant species for the uploaded image.
#Dataset
The project utilizes a publicly available dataset of plant leaf images annotated with species labels.
The dataset includes images of various medicinal plant species, along with their corresponding labels.
Proper attribution and citation of the dataset source are provided in the project documentation.
